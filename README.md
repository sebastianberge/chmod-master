# CHMOD-MASTER

A simple chmod-calculator for creating the correct command.

## A brief overview

Files/directories in Linux are controlled through permissions, which are seperated in three sets:

- Owner
- Group
- Public

CHMOD-MASTER lets you calculate which chmod-command to use for what type of permission you need.

Made for fun, as there allready exists chmod-calculators.
